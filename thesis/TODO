What is does:
	-> slave system, receiveing commands from printer:
	-> so there is need of communication protocol implementation
	-> slave system (mspm0g microcontroller) handles requests from printer and always responsds with asnwer
	-> slave system handle motor moves 

Big caveats:
	-> TI microcontroller
	-> since their mspm0g series of chips is very new, there is bad support (first revision release in mid october)
	-> it was lot of experimenting with motors and sensor, how to setup properly to do thei job!
	-> it was about reading lot of documentation
	-> big part of solution was reading datasheets of electronics used in project


System performance:
-> restrictions on performance (ideal would be every microcontroller can handle this
-> slave system requirements (2kB RAM and 8kB of flash memory)

Flash usage -> plenty of space
	-> current .hex file has around 6kB

	-> developed on two platforms
	-> atmega platform has around, but because of 

RAM usage

uart -> cant poll
	-> on interrupt
time ->
	-> on interrupt one millisecond

adc values -> 
	decision was between polling value (active wait) and interrupt handling, but i have decided it is not neccesary handle values
	since command most of time needs only one value from adc 14 bit resultion -> 
	-> so i dont want to compute all of them on interrupt, despite it will be more precise

i would say result it promising because even low memory and permonace microcontroller can be used with this project


Architecture ->


UNIQUE_PTR is overhead for code



Conclusion && Future work
	-> It turned out , extruder is way stronger motor does not need another support by motor
	-> This solution surprisinly works better. I would say becase of low resolution of 
	-> hal sensor are not hat accurate
	-> better error handling, since right now, when unstucking does not work, print fails and there are no tries to recover from this state
	-> 


Developement of project is harder

Setup is very similar to current MMU
	-> flash firmware to microcontroller using uniflash tool from texas instruments
	-> you have to enable MMU unit in settings
	-> then you have to 

Zeptat se na jednotky
-> mam psat 5 V nebo 5V
-> jestli popisy v kapitole 3 u obrazku plosnych spoju a jejich schemat staci, nebo je lepsi to rozvinout
-> mam pocit, ze nikde nereferencuji, co je feeding system, 
-> dava smysl kapitola Development environment and tools
